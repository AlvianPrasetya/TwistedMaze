/        I. ABOUT         /
/-------------------------/
Twisted Maze is a game that would put you inside an ever-changing maze. Starting
from the middle of a circular maze, you have to find your exit. However, here's the
twist: The maze is not stationary. At certain intervals, the maze will rotate around
the center. So here's the challenge: how fast can you escape?

/-------------------------/
/       II. THEME         /
/-------------------------/
The theme of this year's Game Craft is: TWIST. Oxford Dictionary defines "twist" as
"Cause to rotate around a stationary point; turn". So, we decided to take the literal
interpretation of the word twist and play around it (punny, hur hur hur). We decided 
on a survival-style game with the twisting (or rotating, if you'd prefer) maze as the
unique aspect of our game.

/      III. CONTROL       /
